<h2>Why Good Governance Principles?</h2>

I was wondering to start this project long time for now. Either I was shy or may be, even lazy. Every time I've heard from younger colleagues or acquaintances "I'm not interested in politics", I was so eager sit down and thoroughly explain how wrong they are, but explaining it in person is not a good way to go.
After all I'm also out of politics quite some time and it is not "politics" as such, but quality of governance aka Good Governance that attracts my interest. So I decided to mix my public service experience with managerial one, add some Develometrics (development discipline I invented long time ago) and **INNER JOIN** with my current duties of complex systems/digital transformation architect to develop KPI system to assess the quality of governance. I'm calling this Good Governance Principles and if accidentally find any similarities with Python PEPs, you are not that far from the truth, GGPs are PEPs for the Good Governance.
